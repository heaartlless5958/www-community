There is a great need for a new generation of skilled appsec professionals, but there are few entry-level jobs and places to learn. That needs to change. This session will talk about work Robert has done with several different universities (University of Southern California, University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and Grand Canyon University) to help bring application security awareness to students in a variety of fashions and some of the ways this helps them find work after graduation. Particular attention will be given to work as part of the CHOPS (CyberSecurity Hands On Problem Solving) certification program at Arizona State, and to work done with USC related to their MBV program.\n\n### **Speaker:**\n\n**Robert Cuddy**"

Thank you to those that attended.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [Belles Hot Chicken Melbourne CBD](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZCbuCRXHYPysqmcA) as our location for next month. On 7th May 2025 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get. We will take note of no-shows, and to make sure we've got space for those that do actually attend, your RSVP may be deprioritised for future events.\n\n**If you're having trouble finding us**, send a message to [Dan on Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/4yti0PmJCFvXhLH_vmLcxO7Xy3VAM_yY9wRhOQCA1qn7UqWh1nFBa4rNCccfHyhW).\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. *You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend*. This isn't the place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

        "description": "**Welcome to our OWASP Tampa 2025-May Lunch and Learn!**\nWe invite you to join us and members of our local Tampa Bay community to hear from industry experts in cybersecurity. This lunch and learn will bring topics that influence discussion among your peers and provide a venue to meet others that share your passions.\n\n**Agenda**:\n\n* 11:15am - Registration and Lunch\n* 12:00pm - Speaker - Jason Mueller - Crowdsourced Security in Practice: Lessons from the Frontlines\n* 1:15pm - Depart\n\n**Speaker**:\nJason Mueller is a cybersecurity professional and former U.S. Navy cryptologist with over 20yrs of hands-on experience in cyber operations. Having worked across government, defense, and commercial sectors, Jason brings a unique perspective on the evolving threat landscape and how organizations can stay ahead of it. At Bugcrowd, he helps security teams harness the power of crowdsourced security to identify and remediate risk at scale. With a background rooted in operational security and a deep appreciation for the hacker mindset, Jason is passionate about helping organizations adopt modern, proactive approaches to cybersecurity that are both practical and impactful.\n\n**Abstract**:\nAs threats evolve faster than ever, traditional security models struggle to keep pace. Enter crowdsourced security\u2014a model that taps into the global hacker community to uncover vulnerabilities before adversaries do. In this session, we\u2019ll explore how Bugcrowd is helping organizations\u2014from startups to the federal government\u2014scale their security programs through managed bug bounty, vulnerability disclosure, and penetration testing. We\u2019ll walk through real-world lessons learned, common pitfalls, and how aligning with frameworks like OWASP Top 10 enhances outcomes. Whether you\u2019re an AppSec professional, pentester, or just curious about the power of ethical hacking at scale, this session will provide insights you can take back to your own environment.\n\n**Location**:\nGuidePoint Security\n3030 N Rocky Point Dr W\nSTE 600\nTampa, FL 33607\n\n**Sponsors**:\nBugcrowd - [https://www.bugcrowd.com/](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)"

Explore the tangible impact of AI-generated code in this session by playing with fire \u2013 Using GPT-driven prompts, we\u2019ll build a fully functional application, and in real time, we\u2019ll uncover how common security flaws like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and weak authentication can manifest in AI-generated code.\nThrough hands-on exploration, we\u2019ll walk through the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and how these risks could be avoided with secure coding practices, defined policies, developer guardrails, and thorough security audits and code reviews.\n\nBy the end of the session, you'll have a deep understanding of how to:\n\n* Recognize and assess the risks AI introduces in your code.\n* Implement secure coding practices and enforce security policies.\n* Integrate security audits, code reviews, and testing into your development workflow to ensure AI-generated code is safe for production.\n\nThis session is vendor agnostic and designed to empower you to reap the benefits of AI without sacrificing security."

        "description": "Four teammates walked into a bar\u2014a developer, an AppSec engineer, a SecOps lead, and a compliance officer. It sounds like the start of a terrible joke, but no one was laughing. They were too busy drowning in alerts, blaming each other, and wondering if their security program had secretly been designed by their worst enemies. Sound painfully familiar?\n\nIn this talk, I'll share the surprisingly entertaining story of how these burned-out heroes discovered The Three Ways of Effective AppSec. Using the metaphor of a modern city (complete with bank robberies, construction projects, and government bureaucracy), they unlocked the power of context, collaboration, and culture\u2014transforming a chaotic security circus into a highly cost-effective (and even enjoyable) program that keeps their software safe from vulnerabilities and attacks.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt trapped in AppSec Groundhog Day, facing endless firefighting, alert fatigue, and compliance busywork, come laugh (and maybe cry) your way toward a practical blueprint for building an AppSec program that actually works."
